# Does humanity need yet antoher blog engine

In the vast digital landscape, teeming with countless blog engines, one might wonder, "Does humanity need yet another blog engine?".The answer, surprisingly, is a resounding "Yes!" Allow me to introduce you to the journey of building NextPresso.js, a unique open-source blog engine that's set to redefine the blogging experience.

## The genesis of NextPresso.js

The inception of NextPresso.js was not a random decision. It was born out of a desire to become an indie hacker when I discovered this community recently #buildinpublic.

I've tried building a business before, and I know firsthand how tough it can be. In any software business, there are two key parts: building the product and selling it. Both are challenging, and juggling the two can be overwhelming.

So, I decided to focus on one thing at a time. For this first venture, I chose to flex my building muscle. I embarked on an open-source project, freeing my mind from the pressures of selling. This allowed me to concentrate fully on the creation process, to learn, iterate, and improve without the constant worry of monetization.

## What to build

Then came the question: what should I build? The answer was closer than I thought. I wanted to sharpen my skills on the tech stack I use at work and keep up with the latest features and concepts. I work as Frontend engineer and I use mainly React and Next.js. Plus, I needed a simple blog that I can own and customize, built on this very stack.

I searched for an open-source blog engine, built using Next.js, React, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. I wanted a codebase that was easy to dive into and tweak to my liking. But despite the plethora of blog engines out there, I couldn't find one that ticked all my boxes.

So, I decided to build a blog engine to suit my personal needs. I knew there would be at least one user: me. There's a saying: "Eat your own dog food."

## NextPresso.js: A labor of love

So, does the world need another blog engine? When it's a labor of love, a tool for learning, and a solution to a personal need, I believe the answer is a resounding "Yes!" I invite you to join me on this journey as we redefine the blogging experience with NextPresso.js, one line of code at a time
