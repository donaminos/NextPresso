<!-- ABOUT -->

## What is NextPresso.js

NextPresso is a modern, open-source blogging platform built with the Vercel Stack: Next.js 13, React 18, TypeScript, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS. It's designed to be simple, customizable, and easy to understand, making it a great choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

Now, you might be asking yourself, "Why on earth do we need another blogging platform? Aren't there enough already?" Well, let me explain...

### Why NextPresso.js

The idea behind NextPresso is to create a blogging platform that is:

- Built on Next.js 13 and React 18: NextPresso leverages the power and flexibility of the latest versions of Next.js and React.

- Monolithic: NextPresso adopts a monolithic design, integrating all its components into a single, cohesive codebase. This approach simplifies management and eliminates the need to handle multiple tools or services.

- Easy to Deploy: We've taken inspiration from the simplicity of WordPress's 5-minute installation. Our goal is to make NextPresso just as easy to get up and running, regardless of your technical expertise.

- Simple Codebase: We've intentionally kept our codebase lean and comprehensible. This ensures that developers, whether novices or experts, can easily navigate through the code, understand its workings, and begin customizing it to suit their specific requirements.
